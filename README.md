# Continuous Integration - Test Code Repository

A demo project to show various aspects of a CI server.

Purpose of files:

- `requirements.txt` Setup a virtual environment for project
- `main.py` Has issues such as unused variables, which will produce warnings in code linting  
- `lib.py` Helper routine for unittest
- `tests` Unit test classes

To use it as source of CI, create a new directory, run `git init` in it, and copy files to that directory.
